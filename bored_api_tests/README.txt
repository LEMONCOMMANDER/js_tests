This sequence of code pieces are meant to be a learning exercise using a YouTube video 
@ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=li7FzDHYZpc

as well as understanding certain logic and syntax using online research, chat gpt, and trail and error.

The purpose is to iterate through some basic functions and run tests - giving an opportunity to practice both jest and 
api calls.

This sequence of projects is not meant to represent an ability to code, as it takes much from gpt, but rather as a sequence
to display growth and understanding bit by bit.
